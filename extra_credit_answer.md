# AWS Deployment Approach for Weather Data Application

This document outlines the approach for deploying our weather data application on AWS, including the API, database, and scheduled data ingestion process.

## AWS Services and Tools

1. **Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL**: For hosting our PostgreSQL database.
2. **AWS Elastic Beanstalk with EC2**: For deploying and managing our Flask API.
3. **AWS Lambda with EventBridge**: For scheduled execution of our data ingestion code.
4. **Amazon S3**: For storing raw weather data files.
5. **AWS Secrets Manager**: For securely managing database credentials and other sensitive information.
6. **Amazon CloudWatch**: For monitoring and logging.
7. **AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild**: For implementing CI/CD.

## Detailed Deployment Approach

### 1. Database Setup (Amazon RDS)

- Create a PostgreSQL database instance in Amazon RDS.
- Configure security groups to allow access only from our application servers and Lambda functions.
- Store connection details in AWS Secrets Manager.

### 2. API Deployment (Elastic Beanstalk)

- Create an Elastic Beanstalk application and environment for our Flask API.
- Configure environment variables in Elastic Beanstalk, retrieving database connection details from Secrets Manager.
- Deploy the Flask application code (`src/app.py`, `src/models.py`, etc.) to Elastic Beanstalk.

### 3. Data Ingestion Setup (Lambda and S3)

- Create an S3 bucket to store the raw weather data files.
- Create a Lambda function that:
  - Reads files from S3
  - Processes them using the logic from `src/ingest.py`
  - Inserts data into the RDS PostgreSQL database
- Set up an EventBridge rule to trigger the Lambda function on a daily schedule.

### 4. Analysis Process (Lambda)

- Create another Lambda function that:
  - Runs the analysis logic from `src/analysis.py`
  - Calculates and updates weather statistics in the database
- Set up an EventBridge rule to trigger this Lambda function after the data ingestion process completes.

### 5. Secrets Management

- Store database credentials and other secrets in AWS Secrets Manager.
- Update application code to retrieve secrets from Secrets Manager instead of using environment variables directly.

### 6. Monitoring and Logging (CloudWatch)

- Set up CloudWatch dashboards to monitor:
  - RDS metrics (CPU, memory, storage, etc.)
  - EC2 metrics for Elastic Beanstalk instances
  - Lambda execution metrics and logs
- Configure CloudWatch Alarms for critical metrics.
- Set up log groups for application logs, database logs, and Lambda execution logs.

### 7. CI/CD Pipeline (CodePipeline and CodeBuild)

- Create a CodePipeline that:
  - Pulls code from the GitHub repository
  - Uses CodeBuild to run tests (`src/test_app.py`) and build the application
  - Deploys to Elastic Beanstalk upon successful builds

### 8. Security Measures

- Use IAM roles to manage permissions for EC2 instances and Lambda functions.
- Implement VPC for network isolation, placing RDS and EC2 instances in private subnets.
- Use security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic.

### 9. Scaling and Optimization

- Set up auto-scaling for the EC2 instances based on CPU utilization or request count.
- Consider using Amazon ElastiCache if there's a need for caching frequently accessed data.
- Evaluate the use of Amazon CloudFront as a CDN if serving static assets or caching API responses.

## Deployment Steps

1. Set up the RDS PostgreSQL database.
2. Create necessary S3 buckets for data storage.
3. Set up Secrets Manager with required credentials.
4. Deploy the Flask API to Elastic Beanstalk.
5. Create and configure Lambda functions for data ingestion and analysis.
6. Set up EventBridge rules for scheduled execution of Lambda functions.
7. Configure CloudWatch for monitoring and logging.
8. Implement the CI/CD pipeline using CodePipeline and CodeBuild.
9. Perform thorough testing of the entire system.
10. Set up additional security measures and optimize as needed.

This approach leverages AWS's managed services to reduce operational overhead while providing a scalable and reliable infrastructure for the weather data application. It allows for easy scaling, provides built-in security features, and offers comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities.
